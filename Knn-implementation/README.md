First Part Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshulmehtakaggl/60k-responses-of-16-personalities-test-mbt

In the first part, the program tries to predict a person's personality according to dataset. My purpose is compare metrics when some variables changed.
To increase accuracy I used 5-fold-cross-validation.
I tested the code K = 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. Weighted and unweighted knn algorithm. Normalized and non-Normalized.

Second part Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ujjwalchowdhury/energy-efficiency-data-set
The second part is almost same the first one. Only diffrence is the program try to predict rational numbers.
